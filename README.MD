# Monty Hall Problem Simulation

## Visualization 

![Visualizaiton of Monty Hall Problem Simulation](./images/sim.png)

From above picture we can see that the Probablity Distribution of Monty Hall problem is greater when picked door is changed than remain unchanged.
And change in variable is accountable for probablity shift.

Au Reviour !
